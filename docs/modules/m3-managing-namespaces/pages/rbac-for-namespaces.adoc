# RBAC for Namespaces

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5 Minutes_

👨‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator_

== Verify Namespace Access 

At this point, you've successfully created two Namespaces by synchronising resources using Argo CD. Verify that you can access them:

. Login to the OpenShift Web Console.
. Select the *Administrator* perspective.
. Scroll down and find the *Home > Projects* section using the side-menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
A Project in OpenShift is a Kubernetes Namespace with some extra annotations. For all intents and purposes, you can treat an OpenShift "Project" as analogous to a "Namespace" during this workshop. 
====
. Find the `project-memes-dev` Namespace as shown.

Great! Now try doing the same thing again, but as a user without the `cluster-admin` role:

. Log out of the OpenShift Web Console by clicking your username in the top-right corner, and clicking the *Log out* link that appears.
. From the OpenShift login screen select the *standard-users* provider, then login using:
    * Username: `foo`
    * Password: `foopassword`
. You should be redirected to the OpenShift Web Console. The *Developer Perspective* will be displayed by default.
. Dismiss the guided tour popup that appears.
. Click the *Project* dropdown, and note that the *foo* user is unable to see any projects!

== Configure User RBAC for Namespaces

You'll need to grant some permissions to the user named *foo* so they can interact with the Namespace you just created. You can grant roles to users for a specific Namespace using a https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/rest_api/role_apis/rolebinding-authorization-openshift-io-v1.html[RoleBinding] CR:


. Open your copy of the workshop GitHub repository (https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt[github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt, window=_blank]), and open the GitHub editor using the period/dot shortcut key. 
. Create a file named _role.yaml_ in the _managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-dev_ directory, and add the following content to the file:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: memes-dev-editors
  namespace: project-memes-dev
roleRef:
  # The role being bound. In this case we're re-using the existing
  # edit role that's defined at cluster scope
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: edit
subjects:
  # Make user "foo" a subject of this role, thus granting
  # them edit access in the project-memes-dev namespace
  - kind: User
    name: foo
    namespace: project-memes-dev
----
. Update _managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-dev/kustomization.yaml_ file to reference the new _role.yaml_ file:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
bases:
- ../../base
- role.yaml
----
. The resulting files should look like this:
+
image::ex4.github-ide-role-namespace.png[]
. Commit and push the change using the *Source Control* section of the GitHub editor.
. Return to the Argo CD dashboard and wait for the *managed-namespaces* project to synchronise, or use the *Refresh* button to trigger a Git pull and synchronisation.

Once the synchronisation is complete, the *foo* user should be able to view and interact with the *project-memes-dev* Namespace:

== Summary

Congratulations! In this module you learned how to:

* Use Kustomize to create resources from YAML templates.
* Create Argo CD Applications directly from the terminal using `kubectl`/`oc`.
* Grant permissions to the Argo CD Service Account.
* Manage user permissions using Roles and RoleBindings, synchronised via Argo CD.
